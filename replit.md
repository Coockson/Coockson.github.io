# Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Khaan Claasz Coockson, a Senior Data Platform Engineer at LEGO. The application is built as a single-page portfolio showcasing professional experience, skills, education, and contact information, plus a blog system for sharing technical insights. The site is designed for GitHub Pages deployment at username.github.io with a modern, tech-focused dark theme.

**Recent Changes (Aug 10, 2025):**
- Removed phone numbers from both hero terminal view and contact section for privacy
- Simplified navigation to show only About (â†’ root page) and Blog links
- Removed server directory dependencies - now purely client-side for static deployment
- Commented out blog functionality with "under construction" message for future restoration

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React 18** using **TypeScript** and follows a component-based architecture:

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme optimized for tech portfolios
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management (though currently no API calls)

The application uses a modular component structure with separate sections for hero, experience, skills, education, contact information, and a blog system. The design emphasizes a dark tech aesthetic with cyan and green accent colors. Navigation is simplified to focus on About, Blog, and Contact sections.

## Static Site Architecture

This is now a **client-only static site** optimized for GitHub Pages deployment:

- **Development Server**: Minimal Node.js wrapper that launches Vite development server
- **Production Build**: Static files generated by Vite, no server-side processing needed
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Blog System**: Uses JavaScript arrays for blog post data - no database required

The server directory contains only a minimal development server launcher for local development.

## Data Storage Solutions

- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for user data
- **Production Ready**: Configured for Neon Database (PostgreSQL) via environment variables

The application uses a shared schema approach where database models are accessible to both frontend and backend through the shared directory.

## Authentication and Authorization

Basic user schema is defined with username/password fields, but no authentication flow is currently implemented. The storage interface includes methods for user creation and retrieval by username/ID.

## Build and Deployment

- **Development**: Concurrent client and server development with HMR
- **Production**: Static client build served by Express server
- **Asset Management**: Vite handles asset optimization and bundling
- **Environment**: Configured for Replit deployment with specific plugins

The application follows a monorepo structure with client, server, and shared code organized in separate directories. For GitHub Pages deployment, only the client-side code is needed as the blog system uses local data arrays rather than a database.
